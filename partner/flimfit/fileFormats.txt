FLIMfit software: Supported File formats
========================================


Supported formats in OMERO
--------------------------

Time-resolved Fluorescence Lifetime data involves a second time dimension (t) in addition to the real-time dimension (T) provided by the standard 5D OME model. The addition of extra dimensions is supported by OMERO as described in http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/developers/6d-7d-and-8d-storage.html.

The FLIMfit software will work with any images or images that have been imported into OMERO with the ModuloAlong annotation described and the attribute "Type" set to "lifetime".  

For backwards compatibility, the  FLIMfit software will also  work with two types of Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) data that have been imported into OMERO without this ModuloAlong annotation:

1) images imported from  Becker & Hickl .sdt files.

2)  any image where the extra t dimension is encoded in Z and PhysicalSizeZ is set to the spacing between time-bins. (For compatibilty with data imported from LaVision BioTec ImSpector systems by first converting to an OME-TIFF file.) 


Points to note.
---------------

The ModuloAlong annotation described above allows FLIM data to be encoded in any of three dimensions (ZCT). However, we strongly believe that a number of issues of future compatibility with other modalities can be avoided by standardising on the use of one dimension for FLIM. 

We therefore intend to use only ModuloAlongT for FLIM data & we would ask other developers to do the same. Thus leaving ModuloAlong Z & C free for other modalities.


Supported file formats.
-----------------------

The FLIMfit software can also be used with FLIM data files (rather than via OMERO).

The following file formats are supported:

1)  Becker & Hickl .sdt files.

2) OME-TIFF files where the extra t dimension is encoded in Z and PhysicalSizeZ is set to the spacing between time-bins. (As generated by LaVision BioTec ImSpector systems)

3) Data where each plane along the t dimension is stored as separate file and the spacing is encoded in the file name. (For use with gated, wide-field FLIM)
